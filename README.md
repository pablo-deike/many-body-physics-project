# Measurement induced phase transitions

## Course: Computational many body methods physics

### How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There are two main scripts to run the code:

- `site_transition.py`: The script runs the different entanglement entropy calculations per reduced system.
- `time_evol.py`: The script runs the time evolution of the system.
  Both of these will generate datasets that can be used for the `plotting.ipynb` notebook. In this notebook, you can visualize the results of the calculations.
